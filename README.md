# 🌾 NEILIT AI & ML Internship Projects — Farmoduce Initiative

This repository documents the key deliverables from my internship at **NEILIT**, where I contributed to the development of agriculture-focused machine learning solutions under the **Farmoduce** project. The work combined technical modeling, ethical AI framing, and stakeholder-oriented communication to support scalable, community-driven impact.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Applied machine learning techniques using Python to build predictive models tailored to agricultural datasets.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to improve model accuracy and contextual relevance.
- Participated in expert-led workshops and seminars on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Ethical AI practices.
- Collaborated with peers and mentors to document workflows, address limitations, and propose scalable solutions.
- Delivered a comprehensive project report and presentation, synthesizing technical depth with stakeholder-friendly insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (for dashboarding and visual storytelling)
- Git & GitHub (version control and collaboration)
